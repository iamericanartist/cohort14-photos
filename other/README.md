#### Add More!  
If ya'll would like to add other photos up on here, just make a pull request and [put them in the **other** folder!](/other) Be sure to think "_would I want my mom/grandma/boss to see these?_" when you're adding stuff! **KEEP IT CLEAN :dew:ds!**  

PS - (You'll need to replicate the minor markup in the readme.md file in there if you want to see them in the root folder, but that's easy peazy...)
